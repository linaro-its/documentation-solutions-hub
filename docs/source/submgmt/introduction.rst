Introduction
============

If you are a subscription administrator, you can:

* Assign a *seat* to a user
* Remove a *seat* from a user
* Add *permissions* to an existing seat
* Remove *permissions* from an existing seat [TODO]
* Review who has seats, and corresponding permissions, on subscriptions [TODO]

This section of the documentation explains how this can be achieved with the SPIRE CLI tool.

The documentation will be updated when there is a web user interface as well.
