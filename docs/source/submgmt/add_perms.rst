Add permissions to a seat
=========================

The CLI offers two methods of adding permissions to seats - interactive and non-interactive.

With the non-interactive method, all of the information required is passed on the command line:

``spire seat add-permission -s <seat id> -t <target id>[, <target id>] -p <permission id>[, <permission id>]``
