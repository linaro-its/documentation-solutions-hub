**SEAT**

A *seat* on the Solutions Hub defines what a user can do when assigned that seat. A solution might offer a choice of different seats, each with their own sets of permissions.

It is possible for multiple seats from the same subscription to be assigned to the same user. That user's permissions become all of the permissions from each seat, added together. It is not possible for a seat to remove a permission granted by another seat.

**SUBSCRIPTION**

A *subscription* is an arrangement to have access to a solution on Linaro's Solutions Hub.

What access is provided depends on what the solution offers, the *subscription plan* and the *seat* permissions granted.

**SUBSCRIPTION PLAN**

Typically shortened to just **plan**, this defines the seats available for assignment. A plan may place a limit on how many seats can be assigned.
