Accessing and interacting with support tickets
==============================================

If you have created an anonymous ticket (cannot sign in, cannot sign up, website problem), you will only be able to receive updates to your ticket via email. You will be able to reply to that email and send a comment back to whoever is working on that ticket.

If you are signed into the Hub, you can view your tickets by clicking on **Suppport** on the top navigation bar and then clicking on **View support tickets**

The web page will, by default, show any open tickets you have created or been added to as a participant. From this page, you can change the view to specific request types (e.g. "Ask for help (Solutions Hub)") or switch from just open tickets to closed tickets or both open & closed tickets.

Clicking on the reference or summary links will take you to the view of that ticket. From here, you can:

* Click on **Show details** to see additional information provided as part of the ticket.
* Change the status of the ticket if any options are listed beneath the ticket's current status (e.g. "Resolve this issue").
* Share the ticket with someone else. You will need to enter the email address of the person with whom you want to share access to the ticket. They do **not** need to have an account already. An email notification will be sent to them telling them that they have been added as a participant. If they do not already have an account, they will need to :doc:`sign up </using/signup>` with the same email address used when sharing the ticket.
* Add a comment or attachment to the ticket.
