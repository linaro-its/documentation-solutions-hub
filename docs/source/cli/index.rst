SPIRE CLI
=========

SPIRE is the technology behind Solutions Hub that manages the details for organisations, users, subscriptions, seats, resources and permissions.

To help with the management of Solutions Hub while the web user interface is being built, and to facilitate the use of SPIRE from a CI environment, a CLI tool has been created.

The tool is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux, all for both Intel and Arm processors.

As with the web user interface, the CLI tool is under active development and the capabilities of the tool will be developed over time.
