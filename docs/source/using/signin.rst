Signing In
==========

Introduction
------------

When you first go to the Solutions Hub, you will see the public, or "not-signed-in" page. This shows a number of widgets of information but, to interact more with Solutions Hub, you will need to sign in.

Signing In

To sign in, click on the avatar icon in the top-right of the page and click on **Sign In**:

You will then go through the signing-in process, which can vary depending on whether or not you've used the Hub recently. Some of the following steps may not appear, or the screenshots may differ slightly.

At this screen, you have three choices:

1. If you already have a Solutions Hub account **or** if your organisation has an arrangement with Linaro to use their own authentication platform, enter your email address and click on **Continue**.

2. If you have a Google account, click on **Continue with Google** to authenticate with that account.

3. Otherwise, click on **Sign up** to create a new account.
