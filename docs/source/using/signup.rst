Sign Up For A New Account
-------------------------

After clicking on **Sign up**, the screen will change slightly but you still have three choices:

1. If you have a Google account, click on **Continue with Google** to authenticate with that account.

2. If you already have a Solutions Hub account **or** if your organisation has an arrangement with Linaro to use their own authentication platform, click on **Log in** to sign in with that account.

3. Otherwise, enter the email address you want to use with Linaro Solutions Hub and click on **Continue**.
